beanunit
=========================
Is a unit test extension for testing beans.

=========================
GOAL
=========================
The goal of this jar is to peform useful unit tests on beans of different kinds.
* Tests that makes easy work of testing default behavior pojos (beans).
* Tests for testing beans that are immutable after construction.
* Asserts "simple" beans that are constructed using the "Builder" pattern as documented
  by Joshua Bloch ("Effective Java" - Second Edition).


The actual goal is to make usefull unit tests for objects everybody hates to test because they seem so easy to make
So why test them?
This way there is much more tested on these simple objects without sacrificing anything.
